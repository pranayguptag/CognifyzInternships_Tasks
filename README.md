Machine Learning Internship Projects at Cognifyz Technologies
This repository contains the projects I completed during my Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. During this internship, I focused on developing machine learning models for various applications in the food and restaurant industry. Below are the three key projects I worked on:

1. Predict Restaurant Ratings
Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on various features such as location, cuisine, price range, and more.
Overview: In this task, I developed a predictive model that helps estimate the overall rating a restaurant is likely to receive. This model can be used by restaurant owners to gain insights into factors that influence their ratings and by customers to gauge the quality of a restaurant before visiting.

2. Restaurant Recommendation System
Objective: Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences, such as favorite cuisines, location, and price range.
Overview: The recommendation system I developed personalizes restaurant suggestions for users based on their preferences and previous interactions. This system enhances the dining experience by helping users discover restaurants that align with their tastes.

3. Cuisine Classification
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines, such as Italian, Chinese, Indian, etc.
Overview: This task involved building a classification model that accurately identifies the primary cuisine of a restaurant based on its menu and other related features. This model can assist in categorizing restaurants for better search and filter functionality.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries & Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Techniques: Regression, Classification, Recommendation Systems
Conclusion
These projects provided me with hands-on experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Through this internship, I enhanced my skills in data analysis, model building, and problem-solving within the domain of the restaurant industry.
